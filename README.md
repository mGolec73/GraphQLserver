# GraphQLserver
#### Instructions for running:

- Run `git clone https://github.com/mGolec73/GraphQLserver.git`
- Install the required packages
- Run `dotnet run`

Add `/graphql` to the endpoint (e.g., `https://localhost:5000/graphql`) to access the user interface, where you can test queries and view the GraphQL schema to see which queries are available.
